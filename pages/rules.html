        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <h2>Rules for the dice roll game</h2>
        <h3> In this game you're going to try and guess if you throw higher or lower than the computer, If you think
            that you will throw lower than the computer, you choose lower, If you think you're going to throw higher,
            you choose higher, do you think you'll draw? Click draw.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's say u bet for example 10 credits and you win against the computer, you win 10 extra credits, If not you'll lose
            10 credits of your current credits. <br>
            <br>
            There are also a couple rules, following: <br>


            <li>U have to be over 18 years of age, if under 18 its illegal.</li>
            <li>Play at own risk.</li>
            <li>No cheating.</li> <br>

            Follow these rules and you'll have a great time :).
